# _**Airplane Seat Booking System Simulator**_
Description: This is a software application that simulates the process of booking seats on an airplane. This simulator is typically used for educational purposes to understand the fundamental concepts of programming, object-oriented design, and data structures. In this project, I tackled may different instances, such as:

Add a new passenger

Display Empty seats 

Delete passenger from seat 

Find the seat for a given passengers name 

Store program data in to file 

Load program data from file 

View seats Ordered alphabetically by name 

Reset all the seats to empty View all seats 

Quit


Technologies: **Java**

How to Run: Clone the repository, Open the project in a Java IDE and run the code in the Java environment.
